[![3D Model Preview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce1674d1-0fea-459d-8531-50969a107050)](https://github.com/Boondock-Echo/Boondock-Hardware/blob/main/Boondock-Tango/3DFiles/BoondockTango_CompleteAssembly%20v4.stl)

Boondock Tango is here! With all the uncertainty around tariffs, de minimus shipping delays, dutys, etc.  We decided to release a version that you can buy & build at home anywhere in the world!  Remember that we firmly believe in open-source goodness. 

Boondock Tango is a receive only device currently designed to remotely control Uniden BC125AT from our web interface.  You can remotely control your device from anywhere you have an internet connection!  (Currently works on Windows, we're working through some issues on Linux, then we'll work on Mac)

You can modify, make, and even 3d print cases for others for profit anywhere in the world. We are actively encouraging it!  Start an Etsy store, sell them on eBay, etc.  We are not taking a percentagem, but at the same time, if something breaks, you'll need to support the customer.

Designing things takes time.  And if you are so inclined, please consider buying us a cup of coffee, or a can of Diet Dr. Pepper here:

You can find everything you need on ebay, aliexpress, or amazon.
